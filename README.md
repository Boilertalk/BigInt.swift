# :alembic: BigInt

This library is a fork of [BigInt](https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt), a BigInt implementation for Swift.

Based on the original library, this fork doesn't have any dependencies, supports Swift 4.1 on all Platforms
(removed Swift Shim calls for compatibility between different versions) and aims to implement all major
calculations as efficient as possible.

## Example

For examples have a look at the [original library readme](https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt) or look
through the source code.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

BigInt.swift is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'BigInt.swift'
```

### Carthage

BigInt.swift is compatible with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To install it, simply add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "Boilertalk/BigInt.swift"
```

### Swift Package Manager

BigInt.swift is compatible with Swift Package Manager v4 (Swift 4 and above). Simply add it to the dependencies in your `Package.swift`.

```Swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Boilertalk/BigInt.swift.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

After which you can import it in your `.swift` files.

```Swift
import BigInt
```
